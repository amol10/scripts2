I wrote a script yesterday, it is incomplete. The idea is to make some kind of html based blog posts manager, it will have a web page as UI and a small database as backend.

Today, I am going to continue on that, but, in a different way. Yesterday, I wrote the code in JS, today, I am going to translate that to Java.

I have had limited exposure to Java. So, this might be slow.

Let me start by checking if I have JDK installed, probably I don't have it.

I don't have it.

Now, let me download it.

I have started the download, this might take a minute. In the meantime, let me open the code from last night.

I have to rearrange the dir a little, this will include git related commands.

There seems to be some issue with the 'git rm' command, let me do this after I start the installation of the JDK.

The JDK installation is done.

Looks like git and Windows PS/cmd shell don't work together very well. I might have to write a script to achieve this.

Let me do this.

So, this is done, with the PS one liner: '> git mv (Get-ChildItem -Exclude java,node) node'.

This is a little bit off from the task at hand. So, I am going to go ahead a little bit still further, and, commit to it, as a separate task, by finishing it off with a blog post.

The blog post has been written.

I am going to take a break.

I am going to continue now.

Now, that I am off a little, there something I need to check which has come up in my mind. There is some PS cmdlet related to task. Let me check on the Internet for it.

I could not really find much there, except for a command, 'taskkill'. I found one cmdlet of interest, 'Get-PSSession' which could be useful for storing the logs of the PS sessions. More on it later.

I am going to stop now, and, continue the task of translating the JS code to Java code later.
