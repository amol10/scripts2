I am going to work on some code now. There is a lot that needs refactoring/design/etc.

Nothing related to the code is coming up for a revisit. So, I am going to try to install an extension for VS Code, if it is available, one which will make VS Code like Vim.

The extension has been installed.

It might conflict with the existing VS Code key bindings. Let me see. Upon opening a new editor window, the cursor showed in a block form. So, it may be that the Vim extension has taken effect.

Now, let me check the Vim keyboard bindings.

The 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l' key bindings work, upon entering the 'Normal' mode by pressing 'Escape'. I am done here, with the verification for the extension installation.

I am going to try more, to revisit the Vim key bindings, it has been a while since I have used Vim.

It has been done, the revisit, I have revisited the key bindings, 'gg', 'G', 'b', 'w', '$'.

With that done, I am going to go back to code, continue some design work.

I have done some modifications to the code. I have added two new files, one each for a single function. The functions are 'debug' and 'trim'.

I am going to take a break.

I am back.

I have done some more modifications.

There was a brief visit to how the program will read the input parameters. I am going with the config file approach.

The config file will be having the following parameters:
time slice filename
input filename
output filename
E.g.
ts.txt
in.mp4
out.mp4

The config filename will be 'config.txt' by default, to be overridden by a command line parameter.

The intermediate file, video segment list file will have a fixed name, 'vl.txt' and it will be dropped in the current folder.

I am going to stop now. I am going to commit the code.

The code has been committed.
