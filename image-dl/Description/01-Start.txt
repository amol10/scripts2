I have seen a feature on GitHub, GitHub Copilot, it is described as 'Code 55% faster with GitHub Copilot'. I am going to try this.

I have tried it. It seems good, given a line of description, it gave me the python code. The code seems correct.

I need the command line argument option to test this on the command line. Let me modify the description and see if I can get an update of the code. It should be possible.

The modified description seems to have generated the needed code. Now, let me test it.

How to get the code on the local machine is a question. The code is not committed to the GitHub repo. There is no option to do so on the Copilot screen. So, let me download the code and try it.

I have downloaded the code and have tested it. The first URL failed. The second one worked, and, it downloaded the image.

So, this Copilot feature seems to be a good one. It may be a good idea to test it further.

I am going to commit the code now.
